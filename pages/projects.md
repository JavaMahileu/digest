# Projects

All our projects serve one main idea. We want to gather developers together, to share the expertise, to develop community. We are glad to everyone who wants to join us and contribute to any of our projects or even bring your own social idea. Your experience doesn't matter. Your desire to learn is all that matters. Join us for a brighter future of Java Community!

## **JAMA Digest**

We bring java knowledge into the world by collecting the most interesting articles, tutorials and courses about modern and popular java technologies. We are happy to talk not only about Java and Spring, but about Kotlin, Micronaut, architectural patterns, work tools and much more. JAMA Digest is a simple and useful way to be on top of the newest backend solutions.

## Baaja

Baaja is a JAMA community project with the main goal to try and master fresh technologies stack and architectural solutions (we will split it to microservices once it is ready). And the second goal is to get the interactive presentation tool that can be used to make our Tech Talks and Meet Up more fun and interactive.\
